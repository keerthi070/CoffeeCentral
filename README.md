# Description
- The Coffee Central project involves a Graphical User Interface(GUI) for analyzing the optimal location in the city which is nearer to the maximum number of coffee shops in the city while considering the average person's willingness to walk only a set number of blocks for their caffeine fix. 
- The GUI is developed using Python's Tkinter library, providing a way to calculate and visualize the optimal location and paths from location to the coffee shops. 
- The program includes features such as input validation, distance calculation, path tracing, and GUI components for user-friendly interaction.
